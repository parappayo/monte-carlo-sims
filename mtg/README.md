# Monte Carlo Sims - Magic: The Gathering

[Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is a popular card game invented by [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield).

## TODO

* How many booster packs to collect a set given varying rarity conditions?
* Odds of drawing a specific hand, eg. three different combo pieces needing to be present in N cards with 4 copies each

## Simulations

### Draw N Lands

One of the simplest MtG scenarios is calculating the odds of drawing N "land cards" with M draws. In a typical game setup, a player's deck is 60 cards, there are 24 land cards within the deck, and the player draws 7 cards for their opening hand. A result of 2 or 3 lands drawn is desirable. Of course the same simulation can be adapted to figure how many creature cards would be drawn, how many cards of a certain mana cost, etc.
