# Monte Carlo Sims - Magic: The Gathering

[Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is a popular card game invented by [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield).

## TODO

* Build out deck generation to take a dict of card types and counts
* Tweak the CSV output to be more useful as a data set
* How many booster packs to collect a set given varying rarity conditions?
* Odds of drawing a specific hand, eg. three different combo pieces needing to be present in N cards with 4 copies each

## Simulations

### Draw N Cards of Type

One of the simplest MtG scenarios is calculating the odds of drawing N "land cards" with M draws. In a typical game setup, a player's deck is 60 cards, there are 24 land cards within the deck, and the player draws 7 cards for their opening hand. A result of 2 or 3 lands drawn is desirable. Of course the same simulation can be adapted to figure how many creature cards would be drawn, how many cards of a certain mana cost, etc.

A complication occurs where there are also different colour land cards (Black, White, Red, Green, and Blue) as well as multi-colour options (a Black-White land or a Red-Green land, for example.) For a desirable opening hand, a player may want at least one of each of two or more colours, in which case simply drawing three lands isn't sufficient if only one colour is represented.

Note that deck sizes 60 and 40 are commonly used since those are the minimum size limits for constructed and booster draft format events respectively.
