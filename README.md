# monte-carlo-sims

Small programs to simulate probabilistic situations

As always, the goal here is to learn stuff and to shake the cobwebs out of my head. Ideally I want to write some small [Monte Carlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulations and also solve the problems using [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics). I'd also like to build up a collection of fun problems to use as a reference.

## Planned Sims

Some ideas of stuff I want to sim,

* Traditional card games like [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)) and [Texas Hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) are well known for probability scenarios.
* [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) is known for elaborate dice rolling scenarios, mostly because it does not limit itself to six sided dice.
* [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is ripe for different probability distribution sims.
  * How many booster packs to collect a set given varying rarity conditions?
  * Odds of drawing N lands in an opening hand? Mulligan scenarios?
* [Trombone Champ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombone_Champ) hot dog cards are a variation on the MtG stuff.
  * A player task is to collect 10x copies of a [Hot Dog card](https://trombone-champ.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Dog). What the probablility distribution is for how many packs the user needs to open, and what is the probability of having such-and-such more duplicates of some other card than Hot Dog?
* [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) is a turn-based strategy game with some simple dice rolling scenarios.
  * What are the odds where one or both players has a general (+1 to highest die) and/or the defender has a fortification or HQ?
  * How many armies does an attacker need to conquer a territory?
* [Ogre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_(board_game)) is another turn-based strategy game, with a Combat Results Table (CRT).
  * What is the optimal allocation of firepower when targetting units of varying defensive strengths? Is the Ogre player better off making many small, riskier bets or fewer less risky bets?
